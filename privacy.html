    Privacy Policy for Xilog.xyz<br>
    <br>
    Xilog, I and me refers to myself in any capitalization. (Alan D'souza)<br>
    You, the visitor, or the customer will refer to yourself.
    <br>
    The privacy of all visitors to Xilog.xyz is important to me.<br>
    <br>
    On this website, I recognize that privacy of your personal data is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit Xilog.xyz, and how we safeguard this information. I will never sell your personal information to third parties.<br>
    <br>
    Log Files<br>
    As with most other websites, I collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files includes but is not limited to, your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AT&T), the browser you used to visit the site (such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox), the time you visited the site and which pages you visited throughout the site.<br>
    <br>
    Cookies and Web Beacons<br>
    Xilog.xyz uses cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup one time throughout multiple visits, or the ability to login to some features, such as forums.<br>
    <br>
    Xilog.xyz also uses third party advertisements on Xilog.xyz to support the website and myself. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on the site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) basic information including but not limited to, your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).<br>
    <br>
    DoubleClick DART cookies<br>
    Xilog.xyz also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (interest based targeting). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses "non personally identifiable information". It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dartadserving.aspx<br>
    You may also opt out of Google AdSense interest based targeting by visiting https://www.google.com/settings/ads<br>
    <br>
    You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.<br>
    <br>
    Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.<br>
    <br>
    Xilog.xyz may also submit data to Google Analytics, which includes but is not limited to, information about your geographic location, your OS (operating system such as Windows), your browser, information about how you have visited the website, among other things. This data is only used for research purposes, and the information may or may not be visible to Google.
